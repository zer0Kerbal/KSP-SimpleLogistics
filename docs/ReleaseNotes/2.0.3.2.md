# Version 2.0.3.2 - Deployable Serenity
- thank you to forum users @Buzz light fear, @Cavscout74 for the idea!
- for those who have the DLC Breaking Ground installed there is a new feature for two Serenity parts
- the DeployedRTG and the DeployedSolarPanel can now be plugged into a SimpleLogistic's network
### Mini-NUK-PD Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator  (DeployedRTG)
- all the normal rules for RTG apply
- produces .50 EC/s
- produces heat like stock RTG
- range of inclusion in SimpleLogistic Network - currently ~2.4km, can always use relays
- after deploying, must manually 'plug-in' to the SimpleLogistics network.
- existing rtg/solarpanels might not work - might have to pick them up (using RMB/PAW) and redeploying them again
- has a battery of 25 EC units
### OX-Stat-PD Photovoltaic Panel (DeployedSolarPanel)
- produces .15 (max) EC/s
- has a battery of 25 EC units
- needs sunlight
- all the normal rules for solar apply
- range of inclusion in SimpleLogistic Network - currently ~2.4km, can always use relays
- after deploying, must manually 'plug-in' to the SimpleLogistics network.
- existing rtg/solarpanels might not work - might have to pick them up (using RMB/PAW) and redeploying them again
- there is a limitation, SimpleLogistics currently just averages out resources over the network. 
### Add SimpleLogistics! to KAS PrtPylonPwer (so anything attached can draw power)
- Thank you to leatherneck6017 for this idea.
- add KAS-PortPylonPwr.cfg
- experimental: IsActive = True
- FUTURE: need to expand to anything that has cck-lights, including deployable-lights and tracking lights.
- range of inclusion in SimpleLogistic Network - currently ~2.4km, can always use relays
