Pure stock example:**

Build a simple power production ship, may be automated. For this example I'll use Fuel Cells:

You can enable resource sharing from command module right click menu, but as it becomes bigger and bigger with every other mod installed I also added possibility to enable it from Simple Logistics main UI:

Let's do this, now our Generator Ship shares resources, but it is the only ship in network for now:

Now let's bring in something that will mine ore and plug it in. This Driller has no solar panels or any other power source. It'll receive power from the Generator:

Now it's time for ore processor. It's purely automatic and does not have any power sources too. It'll user power from Generator and produce LfOx and MonoProp:

Let's plug it in too. You can see that our Generator shared some LfOx with us already, that's how even resource distribution works:

It'll feed LfOx back to Generator so it will have juice to produce more power, so that Converter will be able to produce more LfOx, to feed it back to Generator, that will produce.......

Let's wait a bit until our network is full of LfOx:

Now let's bring some vessel that really really **REALLY WANTS SOME FUEL**:

As you can see it's tanks are as dry as Sahara. So, how do we refuel it? The answer is obvious: you may plug it into network so other ships will share resources with it.

But what if you just want to fill up your tanks and rock? Pretty simple: every vessel that is near the network may request resources from pool without being part of network.

Adjust sliders to your needs and hit ***Request Resources***:

Yeah, now our tanks are full.

So our lander may depart for exploration:

And our refuelling base is ready to serve another ship:
