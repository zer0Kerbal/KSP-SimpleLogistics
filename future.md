## Future

### more localizations/translations
* continue training to speak more languages
* depends entirely on others providing them
* [x] English
* [x] Spanish
* [x] Russian
* [x] German
* [x] Japanese
* [x] Chinese
* [x] Norwegian
* [x] Swedish
* [x] Italian
* [x] Portugueuse
* [x] French
* [x] Korean
* [ ] Tawainese

### priority logistical control
* -20 to +20
* useful for production and warehousing
* per vessel / per resource
* higher the number the higher the priority
* set production to -20, warehouses to -1 etc
***
### game settings
* max land speed to allow network access
* [x] range (10m to 2500m)
***
### difficulty settings
* [x] 2500m - 1500m - 1000m - 500m - 200m
***
### Point-2-Point
* allows selection of not only what resource, but also from/to which vessel
* vessel priorities (from -20 to 20; higher number > the priority)
* this would allow for nearly automated refueling/mining operations - just set the warehouse to -10; the mining/refining to -15 and since default priority would be 0, it would automatically flow uphill - autorefuel. This would add some complexity, but would greatly improve logistics.
* reserves: ability to optionally set global reserve amount; stretch: per resource/per vessel (store in save file)
***

### Incorporate visual indication of what and where
***

### Resource Deposit
* being able to 'deposit' specific resources (up to network containment max) from unplugged vessels (thanks @RealGecko)
### Resource Deposit
* being able to 'lock' specific resources in specific vessels.

    as commented in Kottabos video thread:
### add game settings/difficulty setting (easy-peasy) for (options):
* [x] situations (all, pre-launch, splashed, landed)
* m/s movement (beyond body) limitations (optional)
* [x] ranges -concerned about performance hit
* stretch: pull in code from cleverbobcat resources for visible AoE
* possibly add EC consumption for use/transfer (opt)
* possibly add in transfer rates
* possibly add in transfer efficiency (losses due to distance etc)
***
### well beyond my current abilities
#### Update GUI
* depends upon another to create and code the GUI
* hopefully withing Unity
* asset package
*update UI to new Unity.UI
*add 'network administration' UI - shows 40,000m birdseye overview of entire network - drill down per vessel or by resource. Think Haystack, but for LogisticsNetworks.
